### Analysis for Business Problem
<p style="font-weight:100">
What we are looking at raw data set of a bank and also all data are frictional. But it is very realistic. This data set got few coloumns. such as RowNumber, CustomerId, Surname, CreditScore, Geography, Gender, Age,Tenure, Balance, NumOfProducts, HasCrCard, IsActiveMember,  EstimatedSalary, ExitedStatus. And There are 10000 customers with data. The Bank measured some things about these customers. The bank has being seen unusual Churn rates. And they seen customers leaving at unusually high rates. Then they wanna understand what the problem is and they want examine the problem and address that problem. And We are going to looking to this data set and get some insights. And finaly our goal is create a system for predicting future to tell the bank which of the customers are at highest risk of leaving.
